# My personal website
See it in action at [kivalm.com](https://kivalm.com)

This is a personal website created using the [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) framework. It is a SvelteKit site that can preprocess markdown files into Svelte components. This allows me to write blog posts in markdown and have it integrated into a fully pre-rendered site.

The site is hosted for free on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kivalm/portfolio).

# Blog posts
The blog posts are written in markdown and are located in the `src/lib/blog/articles` directory. Each markdown file is a blog post, and the front matter is used to provide metadata about the post.

If you want to see more about how to do this in SvelteKit, check out the article [here](https://kivalm.com/blog/dev/Svelte+Markdown).
